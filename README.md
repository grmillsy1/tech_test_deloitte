The main steps I took were to get the overall layout and feel right before adding extras like the modals and the carousel. I used the plugin for the carousel as it was easy to use and customise.


Overall I tried to make the code reusable and responsive, however I did not get round to fully working out the mobile site.
With more time I would prioritise this aspect, working out a nice ux flow for the client.
